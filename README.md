# Scientific DB
This repo is for my database user defined function (UDF) wrappers, procedures based on different scientific libraries (mostly in C). I mostly use MariaDB for large files and PostgreSQL for GIS data and SQlite for quick use. You can find UDF for all these database servers here. Better documentation is coming soon. 

2020-11-10: The first added group is GSL_SF (GNU Scientific Library / Special Functions). Each special function group from GSL is wrapped in exactly the same symbols of each group. The function names are altered with a initial "M". For example "gsl_sf_gamma" function becomes "Mgsl_sf_gamma" function in this UDF code. 
 
## Requirements: 
mariadb-server >10.5, 
libmariadb-dev, 
gsl
 
## Usage: 
For now, just explore the code and header information for to see how to compile, install and load! But basically what is expected to use is (with examples):
### COMPILE:
    gcc -o Mgsl_sf_XXXX.so -DHAVE_DLOPEN -Wall -shared -lstdc++  Mgsl_sf_XXXX.c  -I/usr/include/mariadb -I/usr/include -I. -fPIC -lgsl
### INSTALL:
    sudo ln -s Mgsl_sf_XXXX.so /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/Mgsl_sf_XXXX.so
    sudo service mariadb restart
### LOAD:
    DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS Mgsl_sf_XXXX;
    CREATE function Mgsl_sf_XXXX RETURNS REAL SONAME 'Mgsl_sf_XXXX.so';  
### USE:
    SELECT Mgsl_sf_XXXX(column);


  
## About GSL Functions : 
My code is just wrappers so it does not check the input parameters. Please, refer to the official GSL documentation https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/specfunc.html before you use the functions.
